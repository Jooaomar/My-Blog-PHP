# My-Blog-PHP

In this practical work, we created a blog simulation where the logged in user can create, delete and edit their posts. Users not logged in can comment on posts.

## Tools

* Database: Sqlite
* PDO - PHP
* Apache Server

## how to play?

* First: Make sure you have PHP 7* installed, PDO-PHO and Apache Server is working

* Second: download the project

`git clone https://github.com/Jooaomar/My-Blog-PHP.git`

* run in terminal
 
`php -S localhost:<port>

obs: check an available port if it doesn't work

- Se a aplicação ja estiver rodando
instale o APP carregando a url em seu navegador:

`http://localhost:8000/install.php`
